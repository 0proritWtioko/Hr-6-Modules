# Hr 6 Modules
  
To support this, Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in ascript or in an interactive instance of the interpreter. Such a file is called amodule; definitions from a module can be imported into other modules or intothe main module (the collection of variables that you have access to in ascript executed at the top level and in calculator mode).
 
This does not add the names of the functions defined in fibo directly tothe current namespace (see Python Scopes and Namespaces for more details);it only adds the module name fibo there. Usingthe module name you can access the functions:

A module can contain executable statements as well as function definitions.These statements are intended to initialize the module. They are executed onlythe first time the module name is encountered in an import statement. [1](They are also run if the file is executed as a script.)
 
This imports all names except those beginning with an underscore (\_).In most cases Python programmers do not use this facility since it introducesan unknown set of names into the interpreter, possibly hiding some thingsyou have already defined.
 
Note that in general the practice of importing \* from a module or package isfrowned upon, since it often causes poorly readable code. However, it is okay touse it to save typing in interactive sessions.
 
On file systems which support symlinks, the directory containing the inputscript is calculated after the symlink is followed. In other words thedirectory containing the symlink is **not** added to the module search path.
 
After initialization, Python programs can modify sys.path. Thedirectory containing the script being run is placed at the beginning of thesearch path, ahead of the standard library path. This means that scripts in thatdirectory will be loaded instead of modules of the same name in the librarydirectory. This is an error unless the replacement is intended. See sectionStandard Modules for more information.
 
To speed up loading modules, Python caches the compiled version of each modulein the \_\_pycache\_\_ directory under the name module.version.pyc,where the version encodes the format of the compiled file; it generally containsthe Python version number. For example, in CPython release 3.3 the compiledversion of spam.py would be cached as \_\_pycache\_\_/spam.cpython-33.pyc. Thisnaming convention allows compiled modules from different releases and differentversions of Python to coexist.
 
The \_\_init\_\_.py files are required to make Python treat directoriescontaining the file as packages (unless using a namespace package, arelatively advanced feature). This prevents directories with a common name,such as string, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur lateron the module search path. In the simplest case, \_\_init\_\_.py can just bean empty file, but it can also execute initialization code for the package orset the \_\_all\_\_ variable, described later.

Note that when using from package import item, the item can be either asubmodule (or subpackage) of the package, or some other name defined in thepackage, like a function, class or variable. The import statement firsttests whether the item is defined in the package; if not, it assumes it is amodule and attempts to load it. If it fails to find it, an ImportErrorexception is raised.
 
Be aware that submodules might become shadowed by locally defined names. Forexample, if you added a reverse function to thesound/effects/\_\_init\_\_.py file, the from sound.effects import \*would only import the two submodules echo and surround, but not thereverse submodule, because it is shadowed by the locally definedreverse function:
 
If \_\_all\_\_ is not defined, the statement from sound.effects import \*does not import all submodules from the package sound.effects into thecurrent namespace; it only ensures that the package sound.effects hasbeen imported (possibly running any initialization code in \_\_init\_\_.py)and then imports whatever names are defined in the package. This includes anynames defined (and submodules explicitly loaded) by \_\_init\_\_.py. Italso includes any submodules of the package that were explicitly loaded byprevious import statements. Consider this code:
 
In this example, the echo and surround modules are imported in thecurrent namespace because they are defined in the sound.effects packagewhen the from...import statement is executed. (This also works when\_\_all\_\_ is defined.)
 
Remember, there is nothing wrong with using from package importspecific\_submodule! In fact, this is the recommended notation unless theimporting module needs to use submodules with the same name from differentpackages.
 
When packages are structured into subpackages (as with the sound packagein the example), you can use absolute imports to refer to submodules of siblingspackages. For example, if the module sound.filters.vocoder needs to usethe echo module in the sound.effects package, it can use fromsound.effects import echo.
 
You can also write relative imports, with the from module import name formof import statement. These imports use leading dots to indicate the current andparent packages involved in the relative import. From the surroundmodule for example, you might use:
 
Note that relative imports are based on the name of the current module. Sincethe name of the main module is always "\_\_main\_\_", modules intended for useas the main module of a Python application must always use absolute imports.
 
To help with that, Vuex allows us to divide our store into **modules**. Each module can contain its own state, mutations, actions, getters, and even nested modules - it's fractal all the way down:
 
By default, actions and mutations are still registered under the **global namespace** - this allows multiple modules to react to the same action/mutation type. Getters are also registered in the global namespace by default. However, this currently has no functional purpose (it's as is to avoid breaking changes). You must be careful not to define two getters with the same name in different, non-namespaced modules, resulting in an error.
 
If you want your modules to be more self-contained or reusable, you can mark it as namespaced with namespaced: true. When the module is registered, all of its getters, actions and mutations will be automatically namespaced based on the path the module is registered at. For example:
 
Namespaced getters and actions will receive localized getters, dispatch and commit. In other words, you can use the module assets without writing prefix in the same module. Toggling between namespaced or not does not affect the code inside the module.
 
If you want to use global state and getters, rootState and rootGetters are passed as the 3rd and 4th arguments to getter functions, and also exposed as properties on the context object passed to action functions.
 
You may care about unpredictable namespacing for your modules when you create a plugin that provides the modules and let users add them to a Vuex store. Your modules will be also namespaced if the plugin users add your modules under a namespaced module. To adapt this situation, you may need to receive a namespace value via your plugin option:
 
Dynamic module registration makes it possible for other Vue plugins to also leverage Vuex for state management by attaching a module to the application's store. For example, the vuex-router-sync library integrates vue-router with vuex by managing the application's route state in a dynamically attached module.
 
Note that you may check if the module is already registered to the store or not via store.hasModule(moduleName) method. One thing to keep in mind is that nested modules should be passed as arrays for both the registerModule and hasModule and not as a string with the path to the module.
 
It may be likely that you want to preserve the previous state when registering a new module, such as preserving state from a Server Side Rendered app. You can achieve this with preserveState option: store.registerModule('a', module,  preserveState: true )
 
When you set preserveState: true, the module is registered, actions, mutations and getters are added to the store, but the state is not. It's assumed that your store state already contains state for that module and you don't want to overwrite it.
 
Ansible modules are units of code that can control system resources or execute system commands.Ansible provides a module library that you can execute directly on remote hosts or through playbooks.You can also write custom modules.
 
Similar to modules are plugins, which are pieces of code that extend core Ansible functionality.Ansible uses a plugin architecture to enable a rich, flexible, and expandable feature set.Ansible ships with several plugins and lets you easily use your own plugins.
 
Each module can contain files, discussions, assignments, quizzes, and other learning materials. Module items can be added to the course from existing content or new content shells within the modules. Course content can be added to multiple modules or iterated several times throughout an individual module. Modules can be easily organized using the drag and drop feature. Elements within the modules can also be reorganized by dragging and dropping.
 
**Note:** Keyboard shortcuts can be used to navigate the Modules page. To view a window with a list of keyboard navigation shortcuts, press the Shift+Question Mark keys simultaneously on your keyboard.
 
Students only view module content that has been published and assigned to them. Each module can contain files, discussions, assignments, quizzes, and other learning materials. Modules can be expanded and collapsed.
